**BIOL 1480. Terrestrial Biogeochemistry and the Functioning of Ecosystems**.
Three fundamental multidisciplinary questions will be addressed: How do ecosystems work? What limits the growth of life on Earth? How are humans altering the framework in which all life exists? Earth is basically a closed chemical system, and the reactions that support life are fueled by sunlight. But added to this chemistry and physics is the tremendous influence of life. Life created an oxygen atmosphere; the evolution of biological nitrogen fixation exponentially increased how many organisms could exist, and the soils that support human food production developed only by biologically-mediated processes. Throughout Earth's 4.5 billion-year history changes in Earth's basic biogeochemical processes have been fairly slow. Under our inattentive stewardship, we have almost instantaneously altered all of the major element cycles. We will focus heavily on what these changes mean for life on Earth.

**BIOL 1840. Epigenetics in Health and Disease**.
In this course, students will explore an alternative perspective on genetic regulation beyond basic Mendelian genetics. If we share the same genetic content, why are our cells different, and why do they perform distinct functions? Why do some diseases profoundly affect gene regulation without a genetic mutation to explain them? The epigenome, a dynamic layer of information associated with genetic material (beyond DNA), plays a crucial role in creating genetic diversity. This course will examine epigenetic mechanisms, their regulation, and their impact on various biological layers, from cellular processes to diseases, brain circuits, psychological disorders, and social behavior. While the primary focus will be on human health and disease, students will also explore non-human case studies, investigating a range of organisms, including plants and animals, to demonstrate the diversity and complexity of epigenetic mechanisms.

## Biology
The Biology concentration invites students to study, in depth and in breadth, the science of life and living matter. Whether pursuing the Bachelor of Arts (A.B.) or Science (Sc.B.) in biology, students can expect to learn broadly in the discipline through a selection of courses in three areas: cell and molecular biology, structure and function, and organismal biology. In addition, students pursuing the Sc.B. complete a thematic track through which they gain an in-depth understanding of a particular subfield such as, Immunopathology, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Physiology/Biotechnology, Cell and Molecular Biology, Physical Sciences. The concentration also emphasizes practical skills and experimental design. Concentrators are required to take at least 3 courses with a laboratory or fieldwork component. Within all of these requirements, students have a high degree of flexibility and choice. Broad research opportunities are also available across several departments within the basic sciences as well.
### Standard program for the A.B. Biology
The concentration program for the A.B. in Biology consists of four prerequisite courses in math, chemistry, and a statistics course as well as ten courses in biological sciences, including at least one course in each of the following three areas: Area 1: Cell/Molecular Biology, Area 2: Structure/Function, and Area 3: Organismal Biology.

## Health & Human Biology
Health and Human Biology is an interdisciplinary concentration that provides a rigorous foundation in the biological sciences with substantive course work in humanities and social sciences within a subfield of Human Health and Disease. The program includes: background courses, biology core courses, a set of theme courses, and a Senior Capstone activity. Background courses provide the essential foundations in chemistry, mathematics, methods, and basic biology. These support the Biology core, which is comprised of a flexible menu of intermediate and advanced courses. A required portion of the Biology core is Genetics, a cornerstone of human biology and its interface with other fields. The Biology core underscores the related coursework within the Health and Disease Theme. The Theme courses are social science and humanities courses that form a cohesive, thoughtful grouping. Theme groupings must be approved by the advisor. A required senior capstone course or activity builds on the program's focus.

## Applied Mathematics-Biology
Biology, the science of all life and living matter, is an incredibly diverse discipline offering students the opportunity to learn about topics ranging from the fundamental chemical reactions that fuel all living organisms to the population dynamics of entire ecosystems all the way to the question of how our brains give rise to the complexities of human cognition and experience. Applied mathematics is an increasingly important component of modern biological investigation. Modern technologies have enabled the creation of vast new biological data sets that often require sophisticated mathematical and statistical models for interpretation and analysis. Advances in computing have similarly enabled the simulation of biological phenomena at increasingly fine levels of detail. Entire subfields, such as bioinformatics and computational neuroscience, have developed around these new paradigms of biological investigation. The foundations of these new fields are inherently mathematical, with a focus on probability, statistical inference, and systems dynamics.
The Applied Mathematics – Biology concentration allows students to develop complementary expertise in biology and applied mathematics. Students will focus their advanced biological coursework in an area of particular interest to them. The applied math requirements emphasize those areas of mathematics that have found widespread use throughout all of the biological sciences. The program culminates in a senior capstone experience that enables students to participate in creative research collaborations with faculty.
###  Standard program for the Sc.B. degree
Prerequisites – the equivalent of two semesters of single-variable calculus |   
---|---  
Single-variable calculus is not an enforced requirement for our concentration, but it is a required prerequisite for many of our courses. At Brown, single-variable calculus consists of MATH 0090⟨48⟩ followed by one of MATH 0100⟨50⟩, MATH 0170⟨88⟩, or MATH 0190⟨142⟩. |   
Requirements – 16 courses 1 |

Total Credits | 16 

1  
      
A required course may be replaced by a more advanced course with concentration advisor approval. No course may be used to satisfy multiple concentration requirements. Transfer credits and courses receiving placement credit notation can satisfy concentration credit as long as they appear on the Brown internal transcript. Pursuing honors will require 17 courses – these 16 along with two semesters of independent study courses for the honors research project, one of which can be used to satisfy the capstone concentration requirement. For students with multiple concentrations: calculus, linear algebra, one intro CSCI course, and at most two additional courses can be used for concentration credit in the other concentration(s). 

2  
    
APMA 0260⟨152⟩ can substitute for the multivariable calculus and/or the linear algebra requirements. If it is used as a substitute for both requirements, then students must take one additional approved 1000-level APMA or MATH course not used elsewhere for concentration credit that adheres to the restrictions in footnote 5 and 9 and these additional restrictions: APMA 1910⟨153⟩, APMA 1920, MATH 1090, MATH 1910 and research/independent study courses cannot be used. 

3  
    
MATH 1110⟨154⟩ may be used in place of APMA 0355. If MATH 1110⟨154⟩ is used, then the concentration must include at least three 1000-level APMA courses that adhere to the restrictions in footnote 6. These can appear anywhere in the declaration. Students matriculating prior to Fall 2025 can use APMA 0330⟨155⟩ or APMA 0350⟨156⟩ as a substitute for APMA 0355. Students matriculating in Fall 2025 or later who wish to use APMA 0330⟨155⟩ or APMA 0350⟨156⟩ must also complete the APMA 0355 online bridgework course and pass the in-person bridgework exam that is offered once per semester.  

4  
    
MATH 1120⟨157⟩ may be used in place of APMA 0365. If MATH 1120⟨157⟩ is used, then the concentration must include at least three 1000-level APMA courses that adhere to the restrictions in footnote 6. These can appear anywhere in the declaration. Students matriculating prior to Fall 2025 can use APMA 0340⟨158⟩ or APMA 0360⟨159⟩ as a substitute for APMA 0365. Students matriculating in Fall 2025 or later who wish to use APMA 0340⟨158⟩ or APMA 0360⟨159⟩ must also complete the APMA 0365 online bridgework course and pass the in-person bridgework exam that is offered once per semester.  

5  
    
Students matriculating prior to Fall 2025 can use APMA 1650⟨160⟩ as a substitute for APMA 1655⟨148⟩. Students matriculating in Fall 2025 or later who wish to use APMA 1650⟨160⟩ must also complete the APMA 1655 online bridgework course and pass the in-person bridgework exam that is offered once per semester.  

6  
    
PHYS 0050⟨161⟩ or PHYS 0070⟨162⟩ are recommended. The following course(s) are automatically approved: PHYS 0030⟨75⟩, PHYS 0050⟨161⟩, PHYS 0070⟨162⟩, ENGN 0040⟨163⟩ + (one of PHYS 0040⟨114⟩, PHYS 0060⟨164⟩, a score of 3 or higher on any AP Physics, a score of 4 or higher on IB-HL Physics). When considering alternative course(s) a key criterion is whether both statics and dynamics are covered. 

7  
    
A BIOL placement test score of 30 or higher may be used in place of BIOL 0200⟨39⟩. The placement test score can be found in ASK, in the advising detail view, under the test scores section. This will reduce by 1 credit the number of credits needed to complete the concentration. 

8  
    
Mixing BIOL and NEUR courses is fine. Students are encouraged to take at least one laboratory or fieldwork course. 

9  
    
The tracks (tracks, not areas) are listed at this link to the Biology Bulletin page⟨165⟩ at the end of the Biology ScB requirements. The physical sciences track is not allowed. If the biomedical informatics track is used, then one of the courses must be BIOL 1565⟨73⟩. Substitutions or the use of 2000-level courses requires approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Biology. 

10  
    
1000-level courses in APMA, BIOL, CSCI, MATH, NEUR are automatically approved, including APMA 1910⟨153⟩, APMA 1920. Research/independent study courses cannot be used. At most one of APMA 1910, MATH 1090, MATH 1910, at most one of APMA 1001, MATH 1000⟨166⟩, MATH 1001⟨167⟩, and at most one of APMA 1650⟨160⟩, APMA 1655⟨148⟩, CSCI 1450⟨168⟩, MATH 1210⟨169⟩, MATH 1610⟨170⟩ can be used for concentration credit. Concentrators are strongly encouraged to use this requirement to develop their computer programming skills and to do so before the end of sophomore semester. Many upper-level APMA courses, including APMA 1080⟨150⟩, require exposure to programming as a prerequisite. The following courses are automatically approved for this purpose: APMA 0160⟨171⟩, APMA 0200⟨172⟩, CSCI 0111⟨173⟩, CSCI 0150⟨174⟩, CSCI 0170⟨175⟩, CSCI 0190⟨176⟩, CSCI 0200⟨177⟩, CPSY 0950⟨178⟩ , EEPS 0250⟨179⟩. 

11  
    
The following options can be used to satisfy this requirement
(a) A pre-approved course that satisfies the APMA Sc.B. capstone requirement: currently APMA 1360⟨180⟩, APMA 193*/194* (where * is any combination of numbers and letters; these are the APMA senior seminars).
(b) A pre-approved course that satisfies the Biology A.B. capstone requirement: currently BIOL 1100⟨103⟩, BIOL 1140⟨104⟩, BIOL 1150⟨105⟩, BIOL 1250⟨106⟩, BIOL 1330⟨97⟩, BIOL 1515⟨91⟩, BIOL 1525⟨107⟩, BIOL 1555⟨72⟩, BIOL 1565⟨73⟩, BIOL 1575⟨109⟩, BIOL 1600⟨110⟩, BIOL 1820⟨111⟩, BIOL 1970. Courses over the 2000 level may be used with approval of the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Biology.
(c) A directed research/independent study course from the APMA 1970⟨181⟩/ APMA 1971⟨182⟩, BIOL 1950⟨78⟩/BIOL 1960⟨79⟩, or NEUR 1970⟨115⟩ series that is used for undergraduate research. For students pursuing honors in APMA-Bio, one of the two required semesters of independent study courses can be used.
(d) A directed research/independent study course in a related discipline (i.e. STEM disciplines, ENVS, PHP, etc.) that is used for undergraduate research if the project is relevant to the student's learning goals in the concentration and with approval from the concentration advisor.
(e) An upper-level course related to the concentration (usually a 1000-level or higher APMA or BIOL course) in addition to a research experience equivalent in scope and scale to work the student would pursue in an Applied Math or Biology research-related independent study course. Examples include UTRAs, LINK awards, REUs, research programs at other institutions, the APMA Directed Reading Program, etc. This requires approval from the concentration advisor and appropriate documentation that should be uploaded to ASK.
(f) Other equivalent opportunities not listed, with approval from the concentration advisor. Documentation should be uploaded to ASK.
### Professional Tracks
The requirements for the professional tracks include all those of each of the standard tracks, as well as the following:
Students must complete full-time professional experiences doing work that is related to their concentration programs, totaling 2-6 months, whereby each internship must be at least one month in duration in cases where students choose to do more than one internship experience. Such work is normally done at a company, but may also be at a university under the supervision of a faculty member. Internships that take place between the end of the fall and the start of the spring semesters cannot be used to fulfill this requirement.
On completion of each professional experience, the student must write and upload to ASK a reflective essay about the experience, to be approved by the student's concentration advisor, addressing these questions:
  * Which courses were put to use in your summer's work? Which topics, in particular, were important?
  * In retrospect, which courses should you have taken before embarking on your summer experience? What are the topics from these courses that would have helped you over the summer if you had been more familiar with them?
  * Are there topics you should have been familiar with in preparation for your summer experience, but are not taught at Brown? What are these topics?
  * What did you learn from the experience that probably could not have been picked up from course work?
  * Is the sort of work you did over the summer something you would like to continue doing once you graduate? Explain.
  * Would you recommend your summer experience to other Brown students? Explain.


### Honors
Concentrators that demonstrate excellence in grades and in undergraduate research can be awarded departmental honors. Honors students with primary advisors in Applied Math should follow the guidelines, requirements, and deadlines for honors as described in the bulletin for Applied Math concentrators⟨183⟩ and as published on the APMA departmental website⟨184⟩. Honors students with primary advisors in Biomed should follow the guidelines, requirements, and deadlines for honors as described in the bulletin for Biology concentrators⟨165⟩ and as published on the Biology departmental website⟨185⟩. Students wishing to do honors research with a non-APMA or Biomed advisor should contact the Directors of Undergraduate Studies in APMA and Biology to discuss options.
## Biochemistry & Molecular Biology
How does life work at the molecular level? This question is at the core of the concentration program Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. In earlier years of this discipline, the focus was on structure and function of proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, carbohydrates and small molecules such as vitamins. Today the logical approach and tools of biochemical science are being expanded to new areas in neuroscience, developmental biology, immunology, pharmacology and synthetic biology (the design of analogs of biological systems). Training in biochemistry begins with a foundation in mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. Some courses offered in other departments, including engineering, geology and computer science, are also useful. A key component of this program is the year of hands-on research carried out in collaboration with a faculty member here at Brown. Faculty sponsors are drawn from both the Chemistry Department and the Division of Biology and Medicine, and include basic science and clinical faculty.
### Standard program for the Sc.B. degree
Students must take twenty courses in biology, chemistry, mathematics, and physics, including the following core requirements, some of these may be fulfilled with AP credits.

### Honors Requirements for Biochemistry
All ScB Biochemistry concentrators are candidates for Honors; no separate application is necessary.
The requirements for Honors in Biochemistry are:
* Students must have a majority of either As or S with distinction grades in concentration courses. 
* Two semesters of Independent Study (CHEM 0980⟨194⟩, CHEM 0980S⟨195⟩, CHEM 0981⟨196⟩, BIOL 1950⟨78⟩, or BIOL 1960⟨79⟩). Guidelines and requirements associated with Independent Study are in the Undergraduate Concentration Handbook which can be found at the department website⟨224⟩.
* A Thesis in a form approved by the research advisor, and recommended by the research advisor. Additional information about thesis guidelines will be provided by the Concentration Advisor in the first half of the fall semester.
* An oral presentation of the thesis in a fifteen-minute senior talk followed by a five-minute question and answer period. 
## Biomedical Engineering
Biomedical Engineering (https://engineering.brown.edu/undergraduate/⟨225⟩concentrations/biomedical-engineering/⟨225⟩) is a dynamic and growing field based upon the application of the tools of engineering to the subject matter of biology and medicine. The undergraduate program in biomedical engineering is an interdisciplinary concentration structured as a joint program between the Division of Biology and Medicine and the School of Engineering. Students can take courses from and do research with faculty from engineering, the various departments of biology, and the Brown-affiliated hospitals in Rhode Island. The Biomedical Engineering (BME) concentration shares much of the core with the other engineering programs, but the program’s primary emphasis is on the fundamentals of biomedical engineering, while also allowing students to personalize their curriculum. Biomedical engineers design new drugs, genetically engineer organisms, and devise new medical devices and instruments. They also use their understanding of biology to advance synthetic and naturally-derived materials and products. BME students learn to apply the principles of engineering and science, along with problem solving skills and critical thinking to a broad spectrum of engineering problems. Further, BME is a sound foundation for lifelong education with its emphasis on the use of teamwork, effective communication skills, and an understanding of broad social, ethical, economic and environmental consequences. The biomedical engineering curriculum at Brown prepares students for careers in biomedical engineering and biotechnology, as well as careers in diverse areas such as medicine, law, business, and health care delivery.
The Sc.B. program in Biomedical Engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET <http://www.abet.org/>. It is jointly offered by the School of Engineering and the Division of Biology and Medicine as an interdisciplinary concentration designed for students interested in applying the methods and tools of engineering to the life sciences and medicine. Alumni of the Biomedical Engineering (BME) program will achieve one or more of these program educational objectives (PEOs) within five (5) years of graduation: (1) Serve society through work or advanced study in a broad range of fields including, but not limited to, medicine, healthcare, industry, government, and academia; (2) Apply their deeply creative and versatile biomedical engineering education to solve a broad spectrum of engineering and societal challenges; and (3) Contribute as role models, mentors, or leaders in their fields. The student outcomes of this program are the ABET (1) - (7) Student Outcomes as defined by the ABET Criteria for Accrediting Engineering Programs, available online at <http://www.abet.org/accreditation-criteria-policies-documents/>. The Biomedical Engineering concentration shares much of the core with the other engineering programs and is structured to include more science courses and electives that introduce cutting edge areas in the field of BME.
The requirements regarding Mathematics, Advanced Placement, Transfer Credit, Substitutions for Required Courses, and Humanities and Social Science Courses are identical to those of the Sc.B. degree programs in Engineering. Please refer to the Engineering section of the University Bulletin⟨20⟩ for explicit guidelines.

### Professional Track
While we do not give course credit for internships, we officially recognize their importance via the optional Professional Tracks. The requirements for the professional tracks include all those of the standard tracks, as well as the following: Students must complete full-time professional experiences doing work that is related to their concentration programs, totaling 2-6 months, whereby each internship must be at least one month in duration in cases where students choose to do more than one internship experience. Such work is normally done at a company, but may also be at a university under the supervision of a faculty member. Internships that take place between the end of the fall and the start of the spring semesters cannot be used to fulfill this requirement. On completion of each professional experience, the student must write and upload to ASK a reflective essay about the experience addressing the following prompts: 
  * Describe the organization you worked in and the nature of your responsibilities.
  * Which courses were put to use in your work?
  * Which topics, in particular, were important?
  * In retrospect, which courses should you have taken before embarking on your work experience?
  * What are the topics from these courses that would have helped you if you had been more familiar with them?
  * What topics would have been helpful in preparation for this work experience that you did not learn at Brown?
  * What did you learn from the experience that probably could not have been picked up from course work?
  * Is the sort of work you did something you would like to continue doing once you graduate? Explain.
  * Would you recommend your work experience to other Brown students? Explain. 


The reflective essays are subject to the approval of the student's Concentration Advisor. 
Entry to the Professional Track requires a simple application form to be completed by the student and approved by the Concentration Advisor at the time of the concentration declaration. If the student has not yet declared a concentration, the form may be approved by the Chair of the Concentration Committee. The Concentration Advisor will certify that all Professional Track students have completed the necessary internships and will grant approval for the associated reflective essays. All other requirements remain identical to those in the standard tracks in the concentrations.
## Biophysics
Biophysics is a quantitative science at the intersection of the life and physical sciences. It requires a significant level of competence in physics, chemistry, biology and math as reflected in the concentration requirements. Students should work with their concentration advisor to develop a focused academic plan that complements the required research component of the concentration and allows students to develop analytical and quantitative skills. 
Student Goals:  
Students in this concentration will:
  * Explore the relationship between biological and physical principles by successfully completing foundational courses in biology, physics, math and chemistry
  * Gain an in-depth knowledge of the interdisciplinary nature of life and physical sciences by selecting and successfully completing advanced courses in biology, physics, math, chemistry or related fields 
  * Develop skills to identify and analyze critical questions central to biophysics
  * Apply quantitative methods to problems at the interface of life and physical sciences 
  * Complete a research project with a faculty advisor that focuses on a particular theme or problem in the field of biophysics where students apply knowledge gained throughout the curriculum.

## Computational Biology
Computational biology involves the analysis and discovery of biological phenomena using computational tools, and the algorithmic design and analysis of such tools. The field is widely defined and includes foundations in computer science, applied mathematics, statistics, biochemistry, molecular biology, genetics, ecology, evolution, anatomy, neuroscience, and visualization.
Students may pursue a Bachelor of Arts or a Bachelor of Science. Students pursuing the ScB have the option of electing a concentration in Computational Biology with one of three focus areas: Computer Sciences, Biological Sciences, or Applied Mathematics & Statistics. Both programs require a senior capstone experience that pairs students and faculty in creative research collaborations.

APMA 1655 will be a prerequisite for APMA 1080 starting in Fall 2025. Current concentrators (as of Spring 2025) may still take APMA 1080 with APMA 1650 as their prerequisite but APMA 1655 is encouraged. Students matriculating in Fall 2025 or later will need to take APMA 1655 before taking APMA 1080.
